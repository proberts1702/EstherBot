    "LEARN ABOUT PETE": "Alrighty! Pizza Pete was born in the distant lands of Naples where his Grandma Rosita taught him everything she knew. Though New York thin crust fans often cast doubt on this legend, the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three different pizzas for the visit of King Umberto and Queen Margherita of Savoy. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking the colors of the Italian flag—green (basil leaves), white (mozzarella), and red (tomatoes). According to the tale, this combination was named Pizza Margherita in her honor.",
